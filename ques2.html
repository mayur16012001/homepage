                <h1>Mask</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">
                    A mask is an object normally worn on the face, typically for protection, disguise, performance, or entertainment. Masks have been used since antiquity for both ceremonial and practical purposes, as well as in the performing arts and for entertainment. They are usually worn on the face, although they may also be positioned for effect elsewhere on the wearer's body.

                <p style="color: #757575;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 15px;">
                    Masks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of masks is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain. CDCâ€™s recommendations for masks will be updated as new scientific evidence becomes available.

                <h1>Stethoscope</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">
                    The stethoscope is an acoustic medical device for auscultation, or listening to internal sounds of an animal or human body. It typically has a small disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the skin, and one or two tubes connected to two earpieces. A stethoscope can be used to listen to the sounds made by the heart, lungs or intestines, as well as blood flow in arteries and veins. In combination with a manual sphygmomanometer, it is commonly used when measuring blood pressure.                </p>
                <p style="color: #757575;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 15px;">
                    Most medical professionals choose Littmann stethoscopes because of their outstanding acoustics. The unique design of the stethoscope ensures proper sound transmission, but also a reduction of ambient noise! Each Littmann stethoscope also has an optimised chestpiece, which ensures optimal contact for each physical examination.
                    Of course, there are many other benefits that make Littmann stethoscopes special. Aside from the outstanding acoustics, medical professionals can count on soft-sealing ear tips, tuneable auscultation, adjustable headsets, and next-generation tubing. Below, we have explained these fantastic benefits in more detail.                </p>

                <h1>Thermometer</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;">
                    A clinical thermometer is a thermometer used to measure human body temperature. Most made in the 20th century are mercury-in-glass thermometers. They are accurate and sensitive, having a narrow place where the mercury level rises very fast. A kink in the tube stops the mercury level from falling on its own.
                    These thermometers are used in clinics by doctors, so they are also called a doctor's thermometers or medical thermometers. Most show both Celsius scale and Fahrenheit temperature scales, and run from 35 degree Celsius to 42 degree Celsius.</p>

                    Medical thermometers are cleaned before and after each use, with alcohol.For centuries medical thermometers were large, and took many minutes to register a temperature. In the 1860s smaller, better ones were made, and thus thermometers were more often used. An ear thermometer was invented in the 1960s, which works quickly and easily. Digital thermometers became widespread in the late 20th century.
